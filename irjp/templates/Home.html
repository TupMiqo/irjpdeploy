            <h2>What is Industrial Relation and Job Placement?</h2>

            <p class="para">Industrial relations or employment relations is the multidisciplinary academic field that studies the employment relationship; that is, the complex interrelations between employers and employees, labor/trade unions, employer organizations and the state. The newer name, "employment relations" is increasingly taking precedence because "industrial relations" is often seen to have relatively narrow connotations.Nevertheless, industrial relations has frequently been concerned with employment relationships in the broadest sense, including "non-industrial" employment relationships. This is sometimes seen as paralleling a trend in the separate but related discipline of human resource management.While some scholars regard or treat industrial/employment relations as synonymous with employee relations and labour relations, this is controversial, because of the narrower focus of employee/labour relations, i.e. on employees or labour, from the perspective of employers, managers and/or officials. In addition, employee relations is often perceived as dealing only with non-unionized workers, whereas labour relations is seen as dealing with organized labour, i.e unionized workers. Some academics, universities and other institutions regard human resource management as synonymous with one or more of the above disciplines, although this too is controversial.</p>

            <h2>Your journey starts here</h2>
            <p> This is it. You've made it so far. There is no going back.</p>
            <p>On-the-job training (OJT) is often hailed as best practice in manufacturing. After all, it just makes sense for workers to learn right where theyâ€™ll be applying the training, using the actual equipment.  Workers themselves love it, too, because they are learning by doing. And the frequent one-on-one dialogue provides opportunities to strengthen employee/supervisor relationships.</p>


            <h3>Get lost and find yourself</h3>
            <p> Develop a passion for learning. If you do, you will never cease to grow.</p>
            <p> However, OJT also has its well-documented faults that pose challenges for every manufacturing company. Consistency is at the top of that list. Maintaining a system that ensures any OJT being provided is accurate and has been vetted and approved by operational leaders has historically been difficult to say the least. It can also spread bad practices if below average team members are the ones doling out OJT on the fly.</p>
